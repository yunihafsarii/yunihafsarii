### Hi there, I am Yuni ðŸ‘‹



Here are something about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Hate Speech Detection for Low Resource Language 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing
- ðŸ’¬ Recently I have been tracking my data science journey in my twitter account [@yunihafsarii](https://twitter.com/yunihafsarii)

### Apart from University, I actively seek knowledge from online courses
- [fast.ai course: A Code-First Introduction to Natural Language Processing (Ongoing)](https://www.fast.ai/2019/07/08/fastai-nlp/)
- [Natural Language Processing in Tensorflow (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/KXQYERBDRXVK)
- [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/GZCLJKW8PPC8)
- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/ZYUY9C8Q4ZRA)

### Create some blog posts for my personal journal :
- [End-to-End Machine Learning Project](https://medium.com/@yyunisari158/end-to-end-machine-learning-project-b3387aabde3c)
- [Basic RNNs](https://medium.com/@yyunisari158/basic-rnns-1c4b18d70a3f)
- [RNN with more sophisticated memory cell and architecture (LSTM, GRU and Attention)](https://medium.com/@yyunisari158/rnn-with-more-sophisticated-memory-cell-and-architecture-lstm-gru-and-attention-528fc942d5af)

### My Project so far:
- [Wikipedia Analysis](https://github.com/yunihafsarii/gender-classification-NLP) 
  Crawled biography on wikipedia and found that there is gender bias where men related articles are always dominant over time. In addition, I also crawled the  discussion forum for each of the biography and discovered more negative sentiment among wikipedia contributor when women related article is discussed
  
  Libraries: Pandas, Nltk, BeautifulSoup, VaderSentiment, TextBlob, Matplotlib
  
- [Top TED Talk Speaker Analysis](https://github.com/yunihafsarii/TED-Talk-Top-Speaker-analysis-through-NLP-)
  Crawled the script of the Top TED Talk Speaker and discovered that specific topics and the way they deliver the talk might be reasons for their outstanding performance
  
  Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, BeautifulSoup, WordCloud, Gensim
  
- [EDA on German-US Developer](https://github.com/yunihafsarii/US-Developer-VS-German-Developer)
  Conducted Exploratory Analysis on Developer Survey Dataset to find the difference between developers in Germany and US 
  
  Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy
  
- [Tags Classification on Stackoverflow](https://github.com/yunihafsarii/Tag-Prediction-on-StackOverflow)
  Achieved 66% accuracy to predict tags on stalkoverflow question using linear regression 

  Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, 
  
- [Name-Entity Recognition](https://github.com/yunihafsarii/Name-Entity-Recognition)
  Built LSTM model for name entity recognition on stackoverflow dataset 
  
  Libraries: Numpy, Tensorflow
