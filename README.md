### Hi there, I am Yuni ðŸ‘‹



Here are something about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Hate Speech Detection for Low Resource Language 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing
- ðŸ’¬ Recently I have been tracking my data science journey in my twitter account [@yunihafsarii](https://twitter.com/yunihafsarii)

### Apart from University, I actively seek knowledge from online courses
- [fast.ai course: A Code-First Introduction to Natural Language Processing (Ongoing)](https://www.fast.ai/2019/07/08/fastai-nlp/)
- [Natural Language Processing in Tensorflow (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/KXQYERBDRXVK)
- [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/GZCLJKW8PPC8)
- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/ZYUY9C8Q4ZRA)

### My Project so far:


### Create some blog posts for the purpose of summarizing my knowledge :
- [End-to-End Machine Learning Project](https://medium.com/@yyunisari158/end-to-end-machine-learning-project-b3387aabde3c)
- [Basic RNNs](https://medium.com/@yyunisari158/basic-rnns-1c4b18d70a3f)
- [RNN with more sophisticated memory cell and architecture (LSTM, GRU and Attention)](https://medium.com/@yyunisari158/rnn-with-more-sophisticated-memory-cell-and-architecture-lstm-gru-and-attention-528fc942d5af)
